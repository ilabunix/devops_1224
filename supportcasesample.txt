Hello AWS Support,

We are experiencing recurring CPU spikes on multiple EC2 instances at the same time each day in different AWS accounts, all within the us-east-2 region. These spikes last for a short duration (around 5 minutes) and then return to normal.

Notably, this pattern has been observed multiple times this week across different workloads that are otherwise unrelated, raising concerns that an AWS-side event might be contributing to this behavior.

Details of the Issue:
	•	Region: us-east-2
	•	Impact Time Window: Recurring at [specific time] UTC/CDT each day, lasting approximately 5 minutes.
	•	EC2 Instances Affected: Multiple instances across different AWS accounts, experiencing CPU spikes of 85%+ before returning to normal.
	•	Instance Tenancy: [Shared (default) or Dedicated (host)]
	•	Workload Type: [Example: Bloomreach Delivery Nodes, Java-based application]
	•	No AWS Health Alarms Triggered
	•	We have checked AWS Health Dashboard, but no public incidents have been reported.

Analysis Performed So Far:

✅ Ruled Out Application-Level Causes
	•	No unusual application logs or heavy workloads detected during the spike window.
	•	Health checks are consistent throughout the day, meaning they are not the direct cause.
	•	Garbage Collection (GC) and Cache activity are present but not significantly different from normal behavior.

✅ Checked AWS CloudWatch & Networking
	•	No major spikes in user traffic or ALB request counts to indicate an external load increase.
	•	No unusual memory utilization trends—CPU usage is the only metric fluctuating.

✅ Noticed CPU Spikes in Other AWS Accounts Simultaneously
	•	This suggests a potential AWS-side event rather than an isolated workload issue.

Request to AWS Support:

We would appreciate your assistance in determining if there is any AWS-side event or infrastructure maintenance that could be impacting CPU performance across multiple accounts at the same time daily.

Specifically, can you check for:
	1.	Any underlying AWS infrastructure events affecting EC2 instances in us-east-2.
	2.	Potential noisy neighbor effects on shared tenancy instances.
	3.	AWS hypervisor-level issues or instance migrations occurring at the same time.
	4.	Network or storage (EBS) performance issues that might lead to temporary CPU spikes.

Please let us know if you need additional details, and we look forward to your response.
