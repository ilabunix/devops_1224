If you need to create and push to a branch like feat/initial, hereâ€™s how you can modify the steps:

Steps to Push Local Folders to a Specific Branch

1. Navigate to the Project Folder

Example for project1:

cd ces-base/project1

2. Initialize Git

git init

3. Connect to the GitLab Repository

Add the remote repository URL.

git remote add origin <gitlab_repo_url>

4. Create a New Branch

Create and switch to the feat/initial branch.

git checkout -b feat/initial

5. Add Files to Git

Stage all files in the folder.

git add .

6. Commit the Files

Commit the staged files with a message.

git commit -m "Initial commit for project1"

7. Push to the New Branch

Push the changes to the feat/initial branch on the remote repository.

git push -u origin feat/initial

8. Repeat for Other Projects

Repeat the process for the other projects, replacing the repository URL and following the same steps.

Example for Project 2:

cd ces-base/project2
git init
git remote add origin <gitlab_repo_url_project2>
git checkout -b feat/initial
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for project2"
git push -u origin feat/initial

Example for Project 3:

cd ces-base/project3
git init
git remote add origin <gitlab_repo_url_project3>
git checkout -b feat/initial
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for project3"
git push -u origin feat/initial

Verify the Push

Go to GitLab and check that each repository has the files pushed to the feat/initial branch.
